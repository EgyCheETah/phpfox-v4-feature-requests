Dear friends,

Thank you for your interest in our products.

This is the repo to require new features for phpFox core. If you find a bug, please make a issue here: https://github.com/PHPfox-Official/phpfox-v4-issues/issues/new.

Note: You should describe in detail your requirements. General requirements like "I need a better blogging app", "Better block management", etc. will not be accepted. You can add screenshots or videos for easier understanding.

Now you can delete these messages and start writing your request.

Regards,
phpFox.
